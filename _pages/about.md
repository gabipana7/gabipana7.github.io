## Hi!

### My name is Gabriel and I am a PhD graduate in Physics.

I am passionate about working with data, from database processing, to data analysis and visualization. In my PhD work I tackled projects focused on every stage of the data lifecycle.

On my website you will find a few words about me and my background, a list of my data science projects, and a blog where I post interesting findings while working with data (projects descriptions, new data science libraries and tools I've been using, new research and recent developments in data science or physics).

Have fun, and thanks for visiting!
